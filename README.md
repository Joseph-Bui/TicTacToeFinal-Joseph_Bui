# TicTacToeFinal-Joseph_Bui
This game is played through two devices, an esp32 and a computer. First, the esp32 will send a message to the computer to initialize the game, and if there is a person on the computer then the game will be played. However, if nobody is on the computer, then a script will be run to make moves for player two. The game will proceed until there is a winner.
